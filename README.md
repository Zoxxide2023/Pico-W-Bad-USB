# Pico-W-Bad-USB
Turn a Raspberry PI Pico W into a bad USB

# Setting up your Pico W
Now that you have your Pico W plug a Micro USB cable into your PC (It needs to be a data transfer cable)
Once you have done that hold the boot button on your Pico W and plug it into your PC, once done let go of the boot button
(The button says BOOTSEL above it, it's hard to miss since it's the only button...)

It should come up as RPI-RP2, if it doesn't try the steps above again.

Now that you've set it up drag the uf2 file into your Pico W storage folder and it should automatically restart and it will be named "CIRCUITPY"
